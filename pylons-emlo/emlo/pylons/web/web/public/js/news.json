His roughly 2,000 extant letters, exchanged with astronomers, mathematicians, philosophers, and linguists throughout Europe, document his role not only as a key figure in the international Republic of Letters itself, but also in establishing Oxford as an important hub within that broader network after a period in which it had been marginal to European intellectual affairs. Wallis represents, therefore, a contrasting institutional setting which gave rise to cultures of knowledge instructively different to those fostered by the networks of John Aubrey, Samuel Hartlib, or Jan Amos Comenius. Wallis\u2019s correspondence provides a crucial link between the earliest English correspondence network surrounding the Prussian-born intelligencer Hartlib and the domestication of this kind of networking activity by the era of Aubrey.<\/p>\n","catalogue_provenance":"<p>Wallis regarded scientific correspondence as an important record of intellectual developments, and in consequence published some of his own letters during his lifetime. More recently, a number have been published in modern editions of the letters of his most important scientific contemporaries. Yet the overwhelming majority of his letters remain in manuscript and are virtually unstudied. The Bodleian Library contains the largest manuscript holdings of Wallis\u2019s communications as well a huge range of related material, including his lecture notes from the 1650s, drafts of numerous publications, originals and copies of many of the papers which he deciphered from the 1640s onwards, and notes on books by other authors, as well as his marginalia in books which were or became part of the Savilian Library itself. Hundreds of additional letters, the existence of which has gone unnoticed hitherto, have been discovered recently in the University Archives, throwing fresh light on academic life and university politics throughout Wallis&#8217;s Oxford career. In response to this situation, Philip Beeley and the late Christoph Scriba have published four of the proposed eight volumes of the scholarly edition of Wallis\u2019s correspondence.
