<!--  
 This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and
 should be in the conf directory under the solr home
 (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) 
 or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it.

 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

 For more information, on how to customize this file, please see
 http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml

 PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not
 be used for benchmarking.  To improve performance one could
  - set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
    only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
    value.
  - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
    return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
  - remove all unneeded copyField statements
  - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
    for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
    catchall "text" field, and use that for searching.
  - For maximum indexing performance, use the StreamingUpdateSolrServer
    java client.
  - Remember to run the JVM in server mode, and use a higher logging level
    that avoids logging every request

<schema name="counts" version="1.2">
    <!-- attribute "name" is the name of this schema and is only used for display purposes.
         Applications should change this to reflect the nature of the search collection.
         version="1.2" is Solr's version number for the schema syntax and semantics.  It should
         not normally be changed by applications.
         1.0: multiValued attribute did not exist, all fields are multiValued by nature
         1.1: multiValued attribute introduced, false by default
         1.2: omitTermFreqAndPositions attribute introduced, true by default except for text fields.
